## Request flow

      │
      └── Site status gate (public routes only)
            → status = live?  → pass through
            → status ≠ live and requester has admin session? → pass through
            → status = comingSoon → rewrite to /_status/coming-soon
            → status = maintenance → rewrite to /_status/maintenance
```

**Why `proxy.ts` instead of `middleware.ts`?** Next.js 16 moved the request-interception layer from the Edge runtime to Node.js and renamed the file. Running on Node.js means Prisma works directly — no edge-compatible ORM, no edge Config only as a fallback. The admin path and site status checks can use real database reads.

## Admin path and Edge Config

The admin path is a secret URL prefix chosen during setup. It's stored in `SiteConfig.adminPath` and mirrored to **Vercel Edge Config** whenever it changes (via the Vercel REST API). `proxy.ts` reads it from Edge Config first (fast, no database round-trip), falling back to a Prisma read cached briefly in memory if the Edge Config write credentials are absent. Same pattern for site status.

## Automatic database provisioning (setup wizard)

When `DATABASE_URL` is absent at setup time and `NEON_API_KEY` is configured, the setup wizard can provision a Postgres database automatically:

1. **Neon API call** — `POST https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects` creates a new Neon project. The response includes both a direct and a **pooled** connection string. Cactus uses the pooled one (`connection_parameters.pooler_host`) to satisfy the pooling requirement.
2. **Vercel API write** — `POST https://api.vercel.com/v10/projects/{projectId}/env` writes `DATABASE_URL` (pooled) and `NEON_PROJECT_ID` (for idempotency) as project environment variables.
3. **Triggered redeploy** — writing new env vars to a Vercel project causes Vercel to queue a new deployment. During that build, the existing `build` script (`prisma migrate deploy && node scripts/run-module-migrations.mjs && next build`) applies the full schema.
4. **Readiness poll** — the wizard polls `/api/health` every 5 seconds. Once the database is reachable (redeploy complete, schema applied), the wizard advances to the next step.

**Migrations are never triggered from the wizard.** Provisioning only creates the Neon project and writes the env var. The schema reaches the database exactly as it always does: via the `build` script, run by Vercel during the triggered deployment. The wizard cannot continue in the same page load; the redeploy is the mechanism, not a side-effect.

**Idempotency** — the provisioning action checks for an existing Neon project named `cactus-{VERCEL_PROJECT_ID}` before creating a new one. It also checks the Vercel project's env vars for an existing `DATABASE_URL` to detect a prior successful provision that is still awaiting a redeploy. Double-clicks and page refreshes are safe.

## Authentication and sessions

- **Passkey-first**: WebAuthn registration and authentication via `@simplewebauthn/server`. The relying party ID is derived from `SITE_URL` in production, `localhost` in development. Credentials are stored in the `Passkey` table (public key, counter, transports).
- **Sessions**: Database-backed (not JWTs). A session token is hashed with `SESSION_SECRET` before storage. Suspending a user invalidates their session immediately.
- **Password + OTP fallback** (when email is configured): bcrypt, Pwned Passwords k-anonymity check on registration, mandatory 6-digit email OTP as second factor.
- **Trust this browser**: a `TrustedDevice` cookie skips the OTP step for a configurable number of days.
- **Recovery**: offline single-use recovery code (generated at setup), or email link (30-minute expiry). Both land on the login page's recovery UI.

## Media pipeline

```

                                          │
                                          │  builds URL: https://worker.example.com/<key>?w=<width>&q=<quality>
                                          ▼
                               Cloudflare Worker (workers/media-worker/)
                                          │
                                          ├── validates key (must start with "media/")
                                          ├── fetches from private B2 bucket
                                          ├── applies Cloudflare Image Resizing (width, quality, format=auto)
                                          └── returns with cache headers (1 year, immutable)
```

**Why not proxy through Vercel?** Vercel bills GB-hours of serverless execution. A 10 MB image served through a Next.js route handler on every page view burns real money at scale. The Cloudflare Worker sits outside Vercel's billing, caches resized variants at Cloudflare's edge, and never touches Vercel's function runtime for image bytes.

## Module system

Modules are git submodules living under `modules/<name>/`. Installing one:

1. `POST /api/admin/modules` fetches `cactus.module.json`, validates the manifest, acquires the deploy lock, and commits the submodule via the GitHub Git Data API (no `git` CLI, no shell calls).
2. The commit triggers a Vercel deployment through the standard GitHub integration.
3. During Vercel's build step, `scripts/run-module-migrations.mjs` runs **after** `prisma migrate deploy`. It finds all active modules' SQL migration files, checks the `ModuleMigration` table for already-applied ones, and executes the rest in lexicographic order.
4. The deploy lock is released when the Vercel webhook fires (`deployment.succeeded`) or lazily on the next Modules page load (for Hobby-plan users without webhooks).

Module database tables are **prefixed** (`tablePrefix` field, e.g. `forum_`). They never touch Prisma's migration history. The core Prisma client knows nothing about module tables — modules query their own tables directly.

## Info pages and the Puck builder

Info pages (`InfoPage` model) support two authoring modes controlled by `bodyFormat`:

- **`markdown`** (default): content stored in the `body` column, rendered through the sanitized-markdown pipeline (`marked` + `DOMPurify`).
- **`builder`**: content stored in `builderData` (JSON), rendered via Puck's `<Render>` component (`@puckeditor/core/rsc`).

### Editor

The Puck editor (`@puckeditor/core`) is lazy-loaded — it ships no bundle to any route that isn't the specific page-edit admin screen. The editor is mounted with the full component config (`lib/puck/config.tsx`) extended with custom field renderers (media pickers).

### Reconciliation

`InfoPage`'s real columns (`title`, `slug`, `status`, `metaDescription`, `ogImageId`) are canonical. `builderData.root.props` is a working copy. On every load, root props are overwritten from the DB row. On every save, those four fields are split back out and written to their real columns. This split happens in exactly one server-side location (the save handlers), never client-side.

### Save / publish split

| Endpoint | Required permission | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/admin/pages/[id]/autosave` | `pages.write` | Always `draft` |
| `POST /api/admin/pages/[id]/publish` | `pages.publish` | Always `published` |

The autosave endpoint ignores any `status` field the client sends — it always writes `draft`. Only the publish endpoint can flip status to `published`, and it re-checks `pages.publish` on the server on every call.

### Public render

The public `[slug]/page.tsx` route branches on `bodyFormat`. Both branches share the same draft gate (one check at the top). Builder pages use `<Render config={puckConfig} data={builderData} />` from `@puckeditor/core/rsc` — a server component. The editor bundle is never included in the public-page response.

## Theme system

Themes live under `themes/<name>/`. Activating a theme is a pure database flag flip (`Theme.isActive`) with no redeploy. Installing a new theme follows the same submodule-commit pattern as a module.

The Prickly theme is bundled in `themes/prickly/` — it is not a submodule. No install step is needed for it.
